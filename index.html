    <div>
      <span class="country">Venice!</span> A magnificent city! A city with an
      irresistible appeal to the educated, because of its history as well as its
      present charms.Venice has lots of narrow alleys and walkways for
      pedestrians, but lacks wider streets. Hence, cars are a rarity , so people
      almost solely rely on boat transportation through the many canals.
      Moreover, Venice is known as the "Floating City" for having many rivers
      and bridges that connect the city together.

      zoom past grassy fields dotted with wildflowers and dense forests, all
      with the famous Alps in the background. The slide is almost 2,500 feet
      long and lets visitors board a single-rider or double-rider toboggan and
      whizz down the side of the mountain: you control your speed by pulling up
      or pulling down on a lever.

      <span class="country">The Grand Canyon</span> in Arizona is a natural
      formation distinguished by layered bands of red rock, revealing millions
      of years of geological history in cross-section. Vast in scale, the canyon
      averages 10 miles across and a mile deep along its 277-mile length. Much
      of the area is a national park, with Colorado River white-water rapids and

    />
    <div>
      <span class="country">Santorini</span> is one of the Cyclades islands in
      the Aegean Sea. It was devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th
      century BC, forever shaping its rugged landscape. The whitewashed,
      cubiform houses of its 2 principal towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs
      above an underwater caldera (crater). They overlook the sea, small islands
      to the west and beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles.
